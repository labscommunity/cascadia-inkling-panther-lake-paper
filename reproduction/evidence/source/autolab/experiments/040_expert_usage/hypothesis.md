# 040: measure routed-expert concentration on real fleet traffic

Count routed selections in every MoE layer with
CASCADIA_INKLING_EXPERT_COUNTS=1 (default off). Counts include prompt and
decode routing work, including speculative or fallback evaluations. Shared
experts are excluded. A diagnostic thread per stage rotates one cumulative
layer summary every seven seconds: top-16/32/64 shares, maximum share and
distinct count, with a tag that changes with the row count. The beacon polls
only the latest profile line every five seconds; simultaneous layer reports
would silently lose five of six. Repeated rounds tolerate ordinary profiles
replacing an occasional diagnostic line. No logging on the inference path.

Run the twelve prompt families at fifteen streams for at least ten minutes.
Uniform routing gives top-64 share 25%; the hot-replica proposal requires
over 60% at most of the 64 MoE layers. Collect summaries from all layers,
not only the head or the latest rank. If that concentration is absent, close
the hot-replica premise with the measured distribution.

Prediction: counting overhead is below 1% and exact outputs are unchanged.
Counter unit tests and four pipeline/capture/reconnect tests with counters
enabled passed. Kill the enabled diagnostic after measurement, or sooner
if gates fail or it measurably slows serving.
