## 2026-09-20, iteration 000: instrument first

Question: where does the time go? Nothing on the fleet could answer it (every rank says
"serving"). Built a per-rank stage profile into the engine and a telemetry packet into the
beacon, rolled both out, ran 48/1/11/16/48 streams plus long prompts.

Found: (1) the ranks idle 65-70 % at 48 streams because streams pile into the first groups;
(2) experts are not shared between rows at all; (3) eight boxes are power-capped at 25 W;
(4) prompts over 256 tokens crash the chain; (5) LAN ping is 2-3.5 ms; (6) prefill costs as much
per row as decode. The long-prompt phases took the chain down four times; Tailscale on rank 0
went away mid-run, so the recording of the last phases stayed on rank 0.

Reasoning for the next step: the two targets need different things. Aggregate: fill the
pipeline (M1, M4), then make rows share expert reads (M2) with the iGPU doing the GEMM (M3).
Single stream: the sequential bandwidth ceiling is 2.4 tok/s; only several positions in flight
(S1) can pass it. First release batches M1, T1, the telemetry door and the profile fix.

## 2026-09-20, iteration 001: fill the pipeline, stop the long-prompt outage

Release channel: the connectivity session's signed channel (`release.py publish` -> rank 0
poller -> fleet updater) is now this loop's only door; Tailscale on rank 0 is off. Lock taken,
baseline binaries and overrides kept in `~/inkling-release/baseline/`.

Built while the fleet measured: (a) emptiest-group admission, (b) StreamFeed windows for long
prompts, (c) stage profile reports a request's last window at once, (d) fused MoE made safe at
f16 (power-of-two weight rescale, non-finite fallback, compile at load), (e) pipelined
speculation for a lone stream with StreamRewind, (f) direct reply link last rank -> rank 0.
(a)-(d) are in binary 71973619 (exp 001); (e), (f) follow in exp 002.

Research notes behind (e) and (f):

- Single stream is served by one memory bus at a time (PHYSICS.md): the only way past ~2.4 tok/s
  with layers sharded by box is to have several positions of the stream in flight. A wrong
  guess costs at most one stage time (the corrected frame queues behind one dropped frame at
  rank 1, then follows it down the pipe in lockstep), a right guess saves a whole round trip:
  time per token = a*T + (1-a)*(D*T + ~T/2). The draft decides everything: a = 0.3 gives 1.4x,
  0.5 gives 1.85x, 0.9 gives 5.5x.
- With balanced groups 11 and 16 streams both settle near 9-10 tok/s of steady decode although
  the stage times allow ~16 at 11 streams: the group turn on rank 0 takes ~110-150 ms where a
  stage takes 53-90. Replies are relayed up through nine ranks that each forward only between
  two of their own frames; with every rank busy a reply waits at most of them. A direct
  connection from the last rank removes all nine waits.
- The fused-MoE study (research/fused_moe_f16.md) found the systematic overflow site: routing
  weights sum to 8 x global_scale (about 100 per weight at layer 40), so the weighted sum leaves
  f16. Dividing a row's weights by a power of two and multiplying the output back is exact.
  It also raised a doubt to settle on the fleet: the f32 hint may never have compiled the fused
  kernel, in which case "fused f32 = 1.66 tok/s" was the CPU path plus overhead. The stage
  profile now carries ov_moe_calls / ov_moe_fallbacks / ov_moe_nonfinite to tell.

## 2026-09-20, iterations 002a/002b: the reply path and the first speculation on real hardware

002a (direct reply link): 11 streams 8.9 -> 12.9 tok/s steady, 48 streams 14.7 -> 18.4. First
per-rank view through /api/fleet/telemetry: at 48 streams rank 0 is 96 % busy, ranks 1-7 84-90 %,
the three 60 W boxes 62-71 %. Fleet mean 82 % (exp 000: 30 %). The scheduling losses are gone;
what is left is time per row on the slowest stage, which is rank 0 (46.7 ms/row at 3.9 rows per
frame) because its two dense layers run row by row, then the 25 W boxes (40-43), then the 60 W
boxes (30).

002b (speculation): output character-identical; +5-30 % on free-form reasoning, 2.79 tok/s on a
copy task where 47 of 96 tokens were right guesses. The time model
`T (a + (1 - a) D)` predicted 2.8 for that acceptance. So the mechanism delivers exactly what the
draft's acceptance allows, and everything about the single-stream target is now a question about
drafts: a = 0.5 -> 2.9 tok/s, 0.7 -> 4.6, 0.9 -> 8.6 at T = 58 ms (the 25 W limit lives in T:
at the 60 W boxes' 41 ms the same acceptances give 4.1 / 6.5 / 12).

Reasoning for 004: with the pipeline full, per-row cost is the only lever. Rows must stop
re-reading what they share: the shared experts (2 of every row's 8), the dense layers (all of
rank 0's rows), and routed experts once frames carry enough rows to collide (8.7 rows/frame at
96 streams: 70 routed pairs on ~50 distinct experts). The multi-row int4 kernel is bit-identical
per row, so the gate stays character-exact; it now also runs 8 requests side by side, because a
lone request never enters a multi-row kernel. Batched admission attacks the burst TTFT (91 s mean
at 48): ten 24-token prompts touch ~250 experts together, not 10 x 135. Pre-warm makes every
experiment start from the same state (002a's single-stream number was taken with the expert
cache at 60-90 % and misses up to 1.4 %).

Measurement hygiene learned: compare steady decode (sum of per-stream rates) across experiments,
not aggregate (it includes the admission ramp, a third of a 64-token phase at 48 streams); warm
with many streams after every restart, or pre-warm.

## 2026-09-20, iterations 004-006: rows share reads, admission stops blocking, the power limit is measured

004 (multi-row int4 kernel, batched dense MLP, batched admission, pre-warm): rank 0 left the
bottleneck (181.7 -> 129.6 ms/frame), the 25 W ranks took it over at 95-99 % busy. Steady decode
20.7 tok/s at 48 streams, 24.5 at 96; short-prompt TTFT 9.6 -> 5.8 s; prefill per prompt row 2.5x
cheaper. The frame-time model `17 ms + attention(R) + 6 U(R) t_expert` fits R = 1, 4, 6.4, 14
and 19 within 10 %: decode is one memory read per distinct expert.

005/006 (short engine steps, admission while waiting): two different reasons admissions crawled.
First the engine lock: a step was a whole round, submits waited for it and arrived a few per round.
Then the reply wait: rank 0 blocked on a prefill frame's reply (up to 30 s through 11 ranks) with
most of a burst still unadmitted. 48-request burst TTFT 80 -> 73 -> 44 s, aggregate 12.6 -> 18.7.
264 streams: 34.9 tok/s steady. Platform watts confirm the limiter: ranks 0-7 sit at psys 24-25 W
(PL1 = 25 W) with clocks at 1.8-2.0 GHz; ranks 8-10 draw 42-48 W.

A number worth keeping: once the drafter table was on disk the gate prompts (seen many times) ran
at 8.5, 6.5 and 5.3 tok/s single-stream with exact output. It says nothing about unseen prompts
(1.9-2.0 tok/s), but it is the measured top of pipelined speculation on this fleet and it matches
the time model at a ~ 0.9.

## 2026-09-20, iteration 003: what the 25 W boxes do best

Seven identical boxes, one run, one variable each. Fewer threads lose (12: +14 %, 8: +43 % stage
time), also with the low-power E cores fenced off: all 16 cores earn their watts. Holding the CPUs
out of deep C-states is worth 8 % of a stage for a lone stream and nothing under load. The iGPU is
the find: three of six MoE layers fused at f16 (exact since the power-of-two weight rescale; zero
fallbacks in 1300 frames) cut the stage time by 24 % at 4 rows and 19 % at 14, at 5 W LESS package
power. A fused layer takes 23.7 ms at 15 rows where a CPU layer on the same box takes ~46: under a
power limit the GPU moves experts for fewer joules than 16 throttled cores. Why only three layers:
the kernel gives driver-owned system memory half of RAM by default, and the installer generated
three IRs per box to match.

Reasoning for 007/008: fuse everywhere (007), then lift the half-of-RAM limit and generate the
other three IRs on the boxes (008; run.sh now carries the generator). Memory is not the obstacle:
a fused layer costs 8.3 GB of device memory, a resident CPU layer 7.8 GB, so six fused layers are
~55 GB either way; the obstacle is the 8.4 GB host copy the shim makes while compiling each layer,
which at the sixth layer leaves about 3 GB free. 008 therefore starts on one rank.

## 2026-09-20, iterations 007-008: the iGPU takes every expert layer

007 (overrides only): each rank's three IR layers fused at f16: 45.7 tok/s steady at 264 streams,
unseen-prompt single stream 2.6-3.0 tok/s, answers 12/12; one gate prompt departs from the CPU
reference at character 81 with an equivalent phrase (half precision on the device is not
bit-identical, so an answer-level check joined the gates). Rank 1 showed the second overflow site
the f16 study had predicted: layer 8's shared expert passes 65504 inside the expert, 2.8 % of its
fused calls fell back, and the fallbacks filled the CPU cache until the box swapped.

008a/b: why only three layers per box? The kernel lets a driver own half of RAM (ttm pages_limit),
and the installer generated three IRs to match. But a fused layer (8.3 GB on the device) replaces a
resident CPU layer (7.8 GB): six fused layers need about the memory the box was already using.
run.sh now carries the IR generator (one layer at a time, moved into place when complete), raises
pages_limit for the boot when the overrides ask, and regenerates a layer with attenuated up scales
(layer 8: x 2^-4, multiplied back on the host; exact on the fixture). One rank first (rank 6:
169 ms/frame at 14 rows against 230-260 for its neighbours, memory healthy), then all:
**55.6 tok/s steady at 176 streams, 3.0-3.4 tok/s on unseen prompts, 12.3 tok/s on a memorised
one**, CPU expert cache 0 MiB on every rank, the 25 W boxes as fast as the 60 W ones. The platform
power limit stopped mattering the moment the experts left the CPU.

What limits now: rank 0 (its two dense layers still on the CPU: 60 ms of a 230 ms frame, 96.8 %
busy), swap-ins of driver-owned pages at swappiness 60, and a client-side descriptor limit that made
every phase above ~250 streams meaningless (the Mac's tunnel agent has 256 descriptors).

## 2026-09-20, iterations 009-011: the last stage imbalances

009: rank 0's dense layers onto the iGPU (229 -> 187 ms per frame): 57.9 tok/s steady at 176
streams. More streams stopped helping (352: 54.9): on the device a row costs about 10 ms per rank
whatever the batch, so extra streams only add KV memory, and at 352 streams five ranks swap.
010: 30k tokens of varied traffic into the cross-request drafter: unseen prompts stay at ~3.3
tok/s (a ~ 0.3). Word n-grams saturate; past that a draft has to understand the text.
011: with the experts on the iGPU the CPUs idle, and the per-row part of attention (convs, head
norms, softmax over the row's own cache) still ran row after row: 20-30 ms of a 190 ms frame.
Rows are independent sequences, so they now run concurrently, bit-identical per row:
**64.2 tok/s steady at 176 streams.**

Where the two targets stand, and why:
- aggregate > 60 tok/s: met in steady decode (64.2 at 176 streams, 60.9 at 264); from 9.7 this
  morning. Aggregate over a whole short phase is lower (37-38) because a third of a 32-token phase
  is admitting 176 prompts.
- single stream > 10 tok/s: met only on prompts the drafter has seen (12 tok/s, exact output);
  3.3 tok/s on unseen prompts, from 1.6. A stage is ~40 ms now (24 ms of expert reads at the memory
  bus limit + 13 ms of int8 attention projections, also bus-bound), eleven stages in series are
  440 ms, and only right guesses shorten that: `T (a + (1 - a) D)`. a = 0.3 today. 10 tok/s needs
  a ~ 0.85: a trained draft head on the last rank's hidden states (EAGLE-style), not an n-gram table.

## 2026-09-20, iterations 012-015: the single-stream equation, term by term

The user: "keep going until we hit 10 tok/s single stream. think from first principles and outside the box."
So each term of `a*T + (1-a)*L` got measured instead of assumed.

012 (anatomy): L = 408 ms of bus-bound work + hops + 45 ms that rank 0 wasted computing guess frames before
reading the reply that mattered; a = 0.30. With a fixed near 0.3 the fleet already ran within 10 % of what the
topology allows: the target needs both a and L to move.
013 (offline, the fleet's own text): how right can a drafter be? n-gram tables 30-38 %, Qwen3-0.6B 54 %, 4B 61 %,
an oracle over two drafters 66 %, and by task 0.39 (story) to 0.78 (arithmetic). Nothing reaches the 0.85 that
10 tok/s needs at this L.
014 (the user pointed at their poll-mode NIC driver project): the 3.3 ms LAN round trip was `cdc_ncm` holding small
frames for up to 1.2 ms per direction. `tx_timer_usecs = 0`: 0.2-0.3 ms. Latency no longer rules expert parallelism
out; the 1 GbE wire and a 43 GB re-shard per box remain its price.
015: a 0.6B drafter model beside rank 0 (text in, the target's tokens out, any vocabulary), a rank 0 that reads
replies between guess frames, tables where they are sure. First release broke every lone request for a few minutes
(a waiting round surfaced as an empty engine step; rolled back, fixed, and the test now fails the old code).
Result: prose 3.0 -> 3.1-3.7, structured tasks 5.9-10.9, memorised 10-12, 176 streams 65.5. Exact.

Also fixed: seven raw telemetry files (they name lab hosts) had been force-added with experiment folders and pushed.
The branch was rewritten without them and the harness now writes raw telemetry outside the work tree.

Next, in order of return per effort: distil the drafter on this model's outputs (a +0.1 on prose), expert
parallelism for the lone row as a serving MODE (L -27 %), int4 attention (L -13 %, changes numerics).

## 2026-09-20 evening, iterations 019-029: the goal is now 15 streams

The user re-set the goal: interactive speed for up to 15 streams, ideally 60 tok/s aggregate at 15. Baseline 22.5-23.4
(019). What the numbers say (PHYSICS.md, "The 15-stream regime"; MOONSHOTS.md, F1-F6): eleven frames of 1.36 rows
turn around a ring at eleven times its slowest stage; a row costs 19 ms of a stage, the frame itself 16; the byte
ceiling of this layout is 50-65 tok/s with nothing else in a frame. 60 is not there with exact int4 experts;
30-35 exact, ~40 with lossy options.

* 024 prompts as 8-row windows (config): first token alone 5 -> 2 s, fifteen at once 31 -> 7 s; 24.2-24.6 tok/s.
* 020/023: GPU calls from two threads overlap 1.04-1.10x: the per-call fixed cost is on the device; splitting a
  box's layers between two frames is dead.
* 021/022/025/026: the plugin's MoE decode kernels. They never crashed: `infer()` throws because group 32 is
  refused on Xe2+ (swallowed assert), the engine fell back to host experts, the host cache filled the box, the OOM
  killer did the rest (cache now capped at 1 GiB fleet-wide). With group 64 they work and read at the bus limit,
  but share no expert between rows: worth +8 % at 15 streams, and group 64 is not exact. 029 goes after the exact
  route: six compiled `32`s in the plugin become `16`s (the pre-Xe2 configuration of the same code).
* 027: rank 0's dense layers through the fused-experts op: 51.9 -> 43.7 ms a frame, exact (cosine 0.999999 against
  the MatMul form); the ring gained 0.5 % because rank 10's head (11.6 ms per CALL) paces it just as much.
* 028: the last rank shares one head call between decode frames that are already waiting. **Operator error on its
  first rollout:** the gate and a 15-stream phase were started before the settle check had finished (a build
  task's "exited with code 0" was misread as the publish task's), requests reached a half-built chain, which then
  wedged (streams admitted, no replies, ranks 1-2 "waiting for the previous rank") until the next release. Rolled
  back to 027 within ten minutes, gates pass, re-run pending. Rule: no traffic before "steady 3/3" is on screen.
  Also worth a fix of its own: requests that arrive while the chain is assembling should be refused, not wedge it.

## 2026-09-20 late evening, iterations 029-033: two negatives, a dying entry box, a role swap

* **029, both negative.** The decode kernels run on the exact group-32 weights once six compiled `32`s in the GPU plugin
  become `16`s (the pre-Xe2 configuration of the same code; found by disassembling the byte-identical library on the
  build host; every layer of the canary rank passed the load check at 0.999994). A one-row call then takes 3.0-3.2 ms,
  the same as the prefill path: 026's "2.1 ms" was extrapolated from a call whose second row repeated the first row's
  experts. Fitted on distinct rows the decode path is `1.4 ms + 1.7 ms per row`. The ~1-1.4 ms every MoE call costs
  before its bytes is common to both paths. Queue throttle LOW halves the busy core and saves 1.5 W, and costs 2.3 ms
  a frame in wake-ups. Both removed (030).
* **What paces 15 streams, corrected.** 028's verdict called it a convoy behind the two-row frames. The better reading:
  a ring of F frames turns at the LARGER of (a) the busiest stage's work per round and (b) one frame's trip through
  eleven stages. The last rank does 11 x (36.6 + 11.7) = 531 ms per round (measured round 544-556). Fewer frames
  lengthen the trip (`179 + 3135/F` ms), more frames add fixed cost and head calls (`25 F + 255` ms): F = 11 is
  within 5 % of the optimum. So neither regrouping nor head sharing (which delays a reply by one frame's layers and
  lost 2.5 %) helps; only a cheaper frame or cheaper rows do.
* **The entry box lost all power three times** (13:39, ~20:38 one minute after a reload at idle, ~20:57 one minute
  into a 15-stream phase), its clock back to the firmware date each time. Two lessons that cost time: its reset clock
  blocks every release (the fleet manifest is stamped with it and updaters refuse older manifests; now self-healed in
  the overrides), and a fleet that is "11/11 serving" is not settled until `steady 3/3` (traffic into a half-built
  chain wedged it for ten minutes).
* **032 role swap**, on the user's request: the box installed as rank 8 plays rank 0; the entry box keeps the door,
  plays rank 8 and relays :8000. Built as two releases (verified LAN copy of each other's role data, then a `run.sh`
  whose `ROLE_SWAP` names the pair), tested in two containers named like the boxes before it touched the fleet,
  reversible in one release. Gates exact; 15 streams unchanged (23.6 / 24.6); rank 0's stage 44.2 -> 39.5 ms. The
  entry box, now doing exactly what seven identical boxes do, is 8-10 % slower and draws more: the fault is in the
  unit or its supply, not in the role.
* **033 (offline, the teammate's plan):** the checkpoint's own MTP head is right 0.726 of the time on this model's
  text (0.63-0.69 on prose); its deeper modules need their own attention and conv state kept current (0.11 without).
  One stream ~5-6 tok/s if wired; the logit-lens / delayed-guess idea is closed (0.00 raw through rank 4).
* **For whoever continues:** `OPERATING.md` (how to deploy without closing the only door; `lab.py publish` now refuses
  the releases that would), `QUEUE.md` (every experiment and its status; anyone may add items), the README's status.


## 2026-09-21: continuation, 034-037

The owner explicitly handed publishing over from tahoma-6d to
`autolab-continuation-20260921`. The initial fleet was settled, all eleven
workers served the recorded role swap, and the published binary/run/overrides
hashes matched the documented files.

034: ten frames in flight was negative. Paired fifteen-stream phases were
24.580/24.679 with eleven frames, 24.596/24.444 with ten; 176 streams fell
67.974 -> 64.846. Both output gates passed and every request completed. The
simple round-time approximation overstated the benefit of fewer frames.
Eleven frames are restored in 035.

035 adds an opt-in idle handshake through every worker before rank 0 admits
requests. A delayed-final-worker integration test proves TCP connectivity
alone does not open admission, and that the gate recovers without requests.
Nine pipeline/reconnect/speculation tests passed. The release settled and
both fleet gates passed. Paired fifteen-stream phases: 24.212 / 24.631 tok/s,
all requests complete, first token 6.61 / 6.10 s. Kept for reliability.

036 is kept (harness only): pipeline-role and installed-box identities are
separate; old profile windows are placed by their receive age and duplicate
windows excluded. The role-0 summary now reads installed box 8. The harness
also accepts `--prompt-tag` to compare identical prompts in separate records.

037 is built and tested, now rolling out: bounded f16 residual capture in the
runner, sampled token IDs from the actual last-rank sampler, rewind handling,
and completed-file downloads through a restricted route on the existing
entry relay. Capture, readiness, direct-return, head-sharing and speculation
tests passed. The original 36-prompt corpus and checkpoint are available for
re-scoring the shipped MTP head on fleet states.

037's first deployed capture format was insufficient: raw residuals before
the final RMSNorm exceed f16's range. Gates passed (24.28 / 24.42 tok/s at
15 streams), but downloaded-state validation found infinities in the dump.
Stopped before collecting the study corpus. INKCAP02 stores original f32
residuals; regression test includes values outside f16 range. Any future
12 kB MTP reply must carry normalized states, not raw final residuals.

During MTP runtime review, found an existing dense-device fallback cycle:
`forward_rows` called `forward` for one row after a failed GPU attempt,
and `forward` immediately retried `forward_rows`. The fallback now enters
the host/per-expert path directly. Three dense/kernel tests, nineteen
model/parity tests (including HF goldens), and the speculative pipeline
test passed. This fix is for the next binary; it is not in bf6540ea.

037b settled and passed both gates. F32 capture measured 24.43 / 24.48 tok/s
at fifteen streams, with all requests complete. The 36 original rendered
033 prompts yielded 5,760 actual sampled tokens. All files were finite and
all decoded outputs matched the complete completion API responses. Raw
completion decoding skips structural tokens; the converter now uses that
same rule. Capture tooling kept; writes disabled in 038 after collection.
039's original and quantized MTP scorers are running on the build host.

038 is rolling out the bounded, verified phrase-table merge. Its baseline
on the original 031 prompts was 4.12 explain, 4.26 story, 5.22 code,
9.87 arithmetic, 5.87 rewriting and 4.91 true/false tokens/s. Capturing new
states is turned off in the same release; do not attribute small timing
differences to table seeding alone. Successful merge counts and exact gates
are the primary result.

038 kept: signed release 1789971870 settled, both gates passed, merged
contexts 24,453 -> 194,299. Repeated 031 prompts improved substantially
(4.12 -> 7.73 explain, 4.26 -> 7.22 story); repetition also learns those
phrases, so this is not an unseen-prompt or isolated transfer speed claim.

Before 040, corrected diagnostic delivery: the beacon samples just the
latest profile every five seconds. Simultaneous expert-layer summaries
would lose five of six. A stage reporter now rotates one layer every seven
seconds, out of the inference path; tests cover every layer and lifetime.
041 holds each kernel result for seven seconds for the same reason.

039 complete: on all 36 fleet sequences (5,724 targets), module 0 scores
0.6681 with original full-vocabulary weights and 0.6436 with deployment
weight grids. The original 65k prefix alone is 0.6454: the cutoff explains
most export loss. The predeclared 0.70 bar fails. Redirect runtime qualification
to the conditional 042 fleet-state training study; 117 exact-rendered-disjoint
prompts are selected, and all original 36 stay held out. No MTP assets enabled.

During the first 040 fifteen-stream phase after both gates passed, the API
became unreachable (HTTP 000), while the operator tunnel stayed alive. The
signed report stopped advancing at epoch 1789974050; its clock was ahead of
the Mac, so its apparent negative age did not mean freshness. Stopped the
benchmark process and all fleet traffic, as OPERATING requires. No retry loop
or further publish. The 117-prompt training collection has NOT started.
Await an on-site entry-box check; this resembles the earlier hard stops,
but power loss is not confirmed from the stale report alone. 041's complete
kernel measurements were saved before the outage.

041 completed successfully: int4 QKVR+O took 0.765–0.808 ms vs int8
1.298–1.348 ms on role 5, 39–43% faster. The 9.6–9.7% projection RMS difference
requires a numerical quality decision before serving. 043 candidate/rollback
both passed dry-run guards, with Docker checks for role selection, success,
idempotence, partial-install fallback and start cutoff; not published.

042 training preparation passed four tests covering exact label alignment,
disjoint splits, a learnable synthetic feature transition and zero-adapter
parity/backpropagation. A synthetic CUDA forward/backward through the real
frozen quantized MTP block also passed at 1.8 GiB peak allocated memory.
No held-out sequence was used for gradients; no training has started.

Offline preparation while the fleet door is down: 044 now has a default-off
CPU/GPU overlap probe using independent attention KV/conv scratch and actual
normalization/router kernels. Its non-perturbation test, nineteen model/HF
parity tests, speculative-token exactness test and EP timeout test passed.
Its role-5 once-only wrapper passed Docker rank/no-retry/start-cutoff checks.
No fleet measurement is claimed and no release has been published after
the outage. Shared-bank EP sessions passed all twenty EP tests, including
concurrent drivers, peer error/disconnect isolation and bank reuse; the
multi-driver fleet topology and reshard remain unimplemented.

Harness follow-up from the outage: benchmark phases previously returned success
and continued after failed requests. They now save the failed/incomplete phase,
return nonzero and send no later phases. Warmup failures stop before gates;
a serial gate transport error stops its remaining prompts. Three regression
tests passed. Active requests still need timeout or operator termination.

Owner update, 2026-09-21: no entry-box hardware change yet. The brick/outlet
have not been swapped and the unit has not been replaced. This does not
confirm the cause of the 040 outage or establish recovery. Fleet traffic
remains stopped pending the on-site power/access check.

Owner follow-up, 2026-09-21: the second API/dashboard tunnel is not installed.
The owner explicitly authorized the prepared temporary role-5 int4 quality
canary, with restoration to int8 afterwards; no additional approval is
needed for that scoped trial. A single signed-status check after the update
still returned the exact frozen outage report (epoch 1789974050), so no
traffic or release was attempted. The owner will report back after checking
the entry box on site. Keep fleet traffic and publishing stopped until then.

## 2026-09-21: Streams dashboard deployed after entry clock correction

The owner requested deployment of the other agent's dashboard update. The
current checkout is `7ac7bfb5`, with the Streams UI incorporated into the
branch. The prepared `cascadia-639f0c02-streams` binary retains the currently
deployed engine and embeds the new dashboard; it is 20,709,672 bytes with
SHA-256 `9084392040688eaa6aa9ff6cf6d222f84e24e119e528d91920d12ddd106563c2`.
Verified the ELF architecture, embedded `index-Ba7ZRF0b.js`, rollback binary,
publisher ownership, and absence of another benchmark/publisher process.
`npm ci --no-audit --no-fund && npm run build` passed, including TypeScript
checking. All 23 rebuilt dashboard files match the staged dashboard archive
byte for byte. The signed-channel deployment dry run passed; the intended
release changes only `cascadia`, retaining the current overrides and int8
attention.

Signed status now advances, so the entry box's reporting path has returned.
However, it reports July 27 while the operator's date is September 21.
Its fleet manifest is still version 1789973512 from before the outage.
Publishing with this clock would produce a version older than the one the
updaters already accepted. No release or inference traffic was sent. Asked
the owner to set the installed rank-0 entry box's current UTC system time
at its console, as OPERATING section 5 describes. Once corrected, publish
the verified binary, wait for all eleven workers to settle, run correctness
gates, and verify `/streams` serves the new bundle. The prior binary
`cascadia-639f0c02` remains the rollback for this dashboard-only release.

The owner corrected the entry clock at its console. Verified a fresh signed
report later than the prior fleet manifest and zero requests in flight, then
published release **1790016660** at 13:51 CDT. All eleven boxes received the
new binary. Several workers reported `peer link dead; rebuild needed` while
neighbors restarted; these were the existing supervisor-driven stage rebuilds.
All eleven were serving by 13:58:56, and the fleet reached **steady 3/3 at
14:00:07**. No generation was sent before settlement. Restart counts remained
unchanged through verification: `2 5 5 4 3 3 3 2 0 1 1` by installed rank.

The single-stream and eight-stream correctness gates both passed, including
the same known third-prompt departure at character 81. `/`, `/chat`, `/streams`,
the JavaScript and CSS bundles, and the dark logo all returned HTTP 200 and
matched the rebuilt assets byte for byte. The fleet is available for the
owner's Streams dashboard testing. This release changes no model numerics,
overrides, role assignments, or infrastructure; no int4 serving canary ran.
The longer visual/interactive Streams acceptance checklist remains for testing.

Local monitor fix: an idle head can report its successful full-chain readiness
probe after the initial API startup message ages out of the beacon's journal
window. `lab.py` now recognizes that exact eleven-stage ready phase in addition
to `serving`, while requiring an active worker, matching versions and unchanged
restart counts. Three readiness/stability tests and the three failed-run tests
passed. Restarted only the local settle monitor to pick up this fix; the fleet
received one release.
