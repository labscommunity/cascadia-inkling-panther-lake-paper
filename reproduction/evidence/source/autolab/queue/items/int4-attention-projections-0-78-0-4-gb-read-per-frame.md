## Hypothesis
Attention projections are int8 and read once per frame whatever the row count: 9.7 ms of a 41 ms frame. Caveat
from 027: this GPU's generic int4 MatMul path reads at 26-31 GB/s against int8's 80, so int4 through the ordinary
FC kernel may be SLOWER; measure one layer on one rank first.

## Prediction
-4 ms a frame (+10 %) if an int4 path at >= 80 GB/s exists; otherwise negative.
