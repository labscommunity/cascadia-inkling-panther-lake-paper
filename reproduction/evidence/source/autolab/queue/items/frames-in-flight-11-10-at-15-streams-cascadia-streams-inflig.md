## Hypothesis
PHYSICS.md, "The 15-stream regime, as measured": a round is the larger of the last rank's work per round
(25 F + 255 ms) and one frame's trip (179 + 3135/F ms). F = 11 gives 532 ms, F = 10 gives 507 ms.

## Prediction
15 streams 24.8 -> ~26 tok/s (+5 %); 176 streams unchanged (check it); one stream unchanged.

## Kill
15-stream steady below 24.5 in two phases, or 176 streams below 60.

## Result

034: negative. Fifteen streams 24.580/24.679 -> 24.596/24.444; 176 streams
67.974 -> 64.846 (-4.6%). Both output gates passed. Restore eleven frames.
