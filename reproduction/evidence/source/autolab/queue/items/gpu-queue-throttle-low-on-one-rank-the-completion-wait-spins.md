title: GPU queue throttle LOW (rank 6 A/B): 0.5 cores and -1.5 W, but +2.3 ms a frame; removed
status: done

## Hypothesis
Every rank shows exactly 1.00 busy cores while its iGPU works and 18 W of package power under a 25 W platform limit;
ranks 8-10 with a higher limit are 12 % faster. A spinning P-core is 2-3 W. `OV_GPU_QUEUE_THROTTLE=LOW` lets the
driver sleep on the interrupt.

## Prediction
Rank 6: cores 1.0 -> < 0.5, ms per frame -3 to -5 %, or +3-6 ms if every host wait now costs a wake-up (60+ waits
per frame on the prefill path). Either way it is one release to know.

## Kill
Rank 6 slower than ranks 5 and 7 by more than 1 ms a frame.

## Result
